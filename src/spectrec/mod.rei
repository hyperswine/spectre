    Compiler of Rei to Spectre?
*#

// wait a minute...
// since the code is embedded like any other fn
// I mean is the gpu ISA the same or something?
// so just export the GPU ISA to std::graphics...?
// I mean... maybe...
// or just annotate @shader
// or create a macro shader?
// or a direct annotation def_shader (...){...}
// and instead of compiling that directly to machine code
// uhh use your own AST??

// this is harder than I thought...
